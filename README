This is my personal emacs config package!

NOTE: My Emacs version is 24 (i.e. the dev version). So maybe this
config package doesn't work properly for other Emacs versions.

To use this package, add the following to your .emacs file:

(setq my-config-dir "path/to/this/package/")
(load (concat my-config-dir "config-init.el"))
