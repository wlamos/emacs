This is my personal emacs config package!

NOTE: My Emacs version is 24 (i.e. the dev version). So maybe this
config package doesn't work properly for other Emacs versions.

To use this package, add the following to your .emacs file:

(setq my-config-dir "path/to/this/package/")
(load (concat my-config-dir "config-init.el"))

If you want to change the font size, you can use the following:

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 125)

Just tune the :height to a proper value

- python setting
I simply use emacs-for-python package, which can be reached by
https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/emacs-for-python

(setq my-epy-dir "path/to/emacs-for-python")
