* Todo items
** TODO Problem moving block of raw text left/right using tab key
** TODO Backspace should not alter clipboard buffer
   I can not re-create this problem, a windows thing?
** TODO Org-mode, when I Schedule C-c C-s, it eats eof and causes wrap of following line
   When using dev version, it works at my side, but fails at Larry's side, a windows thing?
